# Table based lexer generator.

  If you are interested in developing lexers i.e read source code token by token,
  here is a C based lexer generator that creates a 
  [table based lexers](https://github.com/basilkottilingal/lexer/).

  The script can be used to create lexer source file like unix lex/
  [flex](https://github.com/westes/flex).For portability, it accepts flex's grammar
  file with few exceptions in the patterns.

# Tokenizer or Lexer reader

  Creates a lexer generator header from a lexer grammar file. 
  The grammar file format is the same as `Flex`'s input file format.

  Convert a lexer grammar file to lexer source file as follows, given
  `make` and c99 supporting `gcc` or `clang` compiler are installed.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:basilkottilingal/lexer.git
cd lexer
make lxr
./lxr -o c99.c c99.lex
```
# Input file Format
  Input file format is the same as specified by flex
```
definitions
%%
rules
%%
user code
```
  There are few exceptions
  1. flex options will be ignored
  2. The OR operator as in the following cases are not-implemented
```lex
%%
"foo" |
"bar" { /*foo or bar : action */ }
%%
```
  Instead you can use single line OR operato, where action falls in the same
  line as the pattern and there are no unwanted white spaces
```lex
%%
"foo"|"bar" { /*foo or bar : action */ }
%%
```

### Regex Patterns

  1. Support most of POSIX ERE symbols in the lexer grammar.
  2. Following regular expression are implemented

| Symbol   | Name         | Meaning / Description                                                   |
| -------- | ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `.`      | Dot  | Matches **any single character** except newline (`\n`)                          |
| `^`      | Beginning anchor | Matches the **start of a line**                                     |
| `$`      | End anchor   | Matches the **end of a line**                                           |
| `[...]`  | Character class  | Matches **any one character** in the set                            |
| `[^...]` | Negated character class  | Matches **any one character not** in the set                |
| `\|`     | Alternation  | Matches **either of the pattern** before o after `\|` in the current group |
| `()`     | Grouping     | Groups expressions as a single unit, affects alternation and repetition |
| `*`      | Zero or more | Matches **zero or more** repetitions of the preceding expression        |
| `+`      | One or more  | Matches **one or more** repetitions of the preceding expression         |
| `?`      | Zero or one  | Matches **zero or one** occurrence of the preceding expression          |
| `{n}`    | Exact repetition | Matches **exactly n** occurrences of the preceding expression       |
| `{n,}`   | Lower-bounded repetition | Matches **n or more** occurrences                           | 
| `{,m}`   | Upper-bounded repetition | Matches **atmost m** occurrences                            | 
| `{n,m}`  | Bounded repetition   | Matches **between n and m** occurrences (inclusive)             |
| `\`      | Escape | Removes special meaning from the next character (e.g., `\.` matches a literal `.`) |

  3. Additionally uses quotes (ex : `"foo"`) for string matching as in flex
  4. NOTE : DOESN'T support any kind of pattern lookahead assertions.
```lex
foo/bar    { /* foo is followed by bar */ }
foo(?=bar) { /* foo is followed by bar */ } 
foo(?!bar) { /* foo is not followed by bar */ } 
```
  So it's upto user to handle these look ahead patterns by appropriate alternative methods
  like using appropriate context sensitive parser, or implementing a lookahead
  using `lxr_input()` and/or `lxr_unput()`

  5. NOTE : DOESN'T support EOF as in flex
```lex
<<EOF>>    { /* flex allows EOF action, but not allowed in this code */ }
```
